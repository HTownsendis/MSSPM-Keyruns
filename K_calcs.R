#################### CODE SUMMARY ##########################################
# Description: Calculates concumption/predation coefficents and overlap 
# coefficients for multispecies surplus production models using biomass and
# Diet composition data as well as consumption to biomass estimates from literature.
#
#
# To estimate predation coefficients for MSSPM - calculates annual 
# consumption of prey biomass by predator biomass for a given year
# To do later: and calculate  the mean (and Std Dev) consumption of all years 
# to be used as initial predation coefficient.
#
# To estimate predation coefficients for MSSPM - uses Pianka (1973) Overlap index
# described further below.
#
# Input: 1) Biomass time series and diet composition data posted to Github. 
# Consumption to biomass estimates in a csv file.
#
# Output: 1) CSV files with summarized predation and overlap coefficients.
